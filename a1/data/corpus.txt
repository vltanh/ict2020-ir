We are no strangers to love
Never gonna say goodbye
Gotta make you understand
Do not tell me you are too blind to see
We know the game and we are gonna play it
I just wanna tell you how I am feeling
Never gonna let you down
You know the rules and so do I
Never gonna say goodbye
We have known each other for so long
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
A full commitment is what I am thinking of
Never gonna run around and desert you
You would not get this from any other guy
Never gonna give never gonna give
Inside we both know what has been going on
And if you ask me how I am feeling
Your heart has been aching but you are too shy to say it
Give you up
Never gonna make you cry
